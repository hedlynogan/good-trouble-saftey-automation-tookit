Building your emergency shortcut on Mac Desktop (instead of directly on iPhone) offers significant advantages:

### Development Benefits
- **Larger screen**: Easier to see and manage complex shortcut actions
- **Full keyboard**: Faster text input for messages and configurations
- **Better debugging**: Step through shortcut logic and inspect variables
- **Easier testing**: Test shortcut functionality before deploying to iPhone

### Apple Intelligence Features (macOS 14.0+)
- **Use Model**: Access AI models to optimize emergency messages and shortcut logic
- **Writing Tools**: Refine message templates with AI-powered writing assistance
